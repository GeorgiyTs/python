I suppose that I shall have to die beyond my means.
I can resist anything but temptation.
I am not young enough to know everything.
Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.
I have nothing to declare except my genius.
I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best.
To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.
I never put off till tomorrow what I can possibly do — the day after.
I like talking to a brick wall- it’s the only thing in the world that never contradicts me!
I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.
